# vivify

This is a test collection bundle done for a specific project

## For Cypress

You need to have node.js to run this project ```https://nodejs.org/en/download/```
After you installed it, open the project in your favorite IDE and ```run npm i``` inside the console. This should grab all dependencies. After that is done, you can run ```npm run ui``` to access the UI launcher for all tests. 

Once every blue moon, Cypress, and Node.js can haywire, and you will have to try to grap cypress via npm ```npm i cypress```. Usually resolves it. Or delete ```node_moduels``` and try again. If anything else goes haywire, contact your nearest EvilTester.

## For Postman
You will need to have Postman for this part ```https://www.postman.com/downloads/```. After you grab it, download the collection file and environment file. Import them inside Postman, and viola.

## Usage
As CLI commands were not in scope, run everything via UI
